Seasoned architect with experience across all facets of modern architecture. I started my career writing device drivers and am currently leading teams into their cloud-native journey while extracting maximum business value. I have experience in Serverless technologies, Cloud-Native Architectures, Cybersecurity, Data and Analytics, and lately Gen AI. Other than that, I am also helping clients discover innovative technologies like Cloud Development Environments (CDE), for e.g. Cloud Workstations, a product that I have worked on together with the Google Engineering team.
